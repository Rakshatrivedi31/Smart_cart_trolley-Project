# Smart_cart_trolley-Project
 A smart cart-trolley system that scans the barcode to enchance our shopping experience.
<br>
We have a scanner that scans the product we put in the cart and automatically generates the bill. It has three payment methods:
<br>
    - Cash
<br>
    - Debit Card
<br>
    - Credit Card
<br>
We can choose any one of these options to pay the bill. The pydouct.py file contains details of all the products available in the store.
